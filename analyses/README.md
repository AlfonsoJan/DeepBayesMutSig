# Building Mutational Signatures in Cancer using Deep Bayesian Neural Nets

## Analyses

The project is organized into the following folders:

### `figures`

The `figures` folder is intended for storing all the created figures during this.

### `multinomial_dirichlet_believe`

The `multinomial_dirichlet_believe` folder is intended for storing all the states from the neural network. Can be accessed on request.

### `NMF`

The `NMF` folder is contains all the NMF and the decomposed NMF files.

### `notebook`

The `notebook` folder is intended for storing notebooks for storing finds that were found.

### `ref_genome`

The ref genome files are saved in `ref_genome`. Can be downloaded using the GenomeSigInfer tool.

### `results`

The `results` folder is designated for storing output files, plots, or any results generated by the code.

### `SBS`

The `SBS` folder is designated for storing SBS files.
