    "SBS13 mutations are likely generated by error-prone polymerases replicating across abasic sites generated by base excision repair removal of uracil [1]. All A3 and AID enzymes deaminate the second cytidine in either CC or TC dinucleotide motifs [2]. However, sequence analysis has determined that not every cognate dinucleotide motif is deaminated, which suggests that the nucleotides flanking the dinucleotide motifs play a role in substrate recognition [2]. The pattern in SBS2 escpecially ion the context of 7, where the majority of the nucleotiudes are thymine, could be explained by the binding residue of A3F‐CTD poly T ssDNA [2].\n"

The mutational signature of AA-induced DNA damage is characterized by a predominance of A:T-to-T:A transversions, a relatively unusual type of mutation that is infrequently seen in other types of cancer, including those caused by other carcinogens.
