All A3 and AID enzymes deaminate the second cytidine in either CC or TC dinucleotide motifs [2]. However, sequence analysis has determined that not every cognate dinucleotide motif is deaminated, which suggests that the nucleotides flanking the dinucleotide motifs play a role in substrate recognition [2]. The pattern in SBS2 escpecially ion the context of 7, where the majority of the nucleotiudes are thymine, could be explained by the binding residue of A3F‐CTD poly T ssDNA [2].\n"
